# Login Form wth Password Toggle

A simple login form mockup for a user to enter their email and password. The password field allows the user to toggle the eye icon to show and hide the password field's hidden text. My reasoning behind doing this project was to learn how to show and hide the password field's hidden text, set up the icons for the toggle effect, and the placement of the icons in the password field.

This project was completed using the video created by [Easy Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NomcZddqBfs).
